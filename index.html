                    <p>A carpenter is a skilled person who works with wood to create many things. They can make furniture like chairs, tables, and beds. They also help to build houses, schools, and other large buildings. They use tools like hammers, saws, and nails to cut and shape the wood. Carpenters need to be strong because they often lift heavy things. They also need to be careful to make sure their work is safe and looks good. It’s fun and exciting to watch them work, turning simple pieces of wood into useful and beautiful things.

                    <p>Furniture is one of the most important parts of the interior of any office or house because it decides the utilization of the space.  I would like to talk about a complete set of furniture that we bought for the drawing Room of my house before almost three years. This set of furniture consists of three sofas, two tables, four chairs, and a decorative cabinet.</p>
